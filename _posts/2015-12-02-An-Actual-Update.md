So I recently purchased a new MacBook Pro, and in the time it took me to get the
device, add in all my new stuff, migrate everything over, establish a new
backup system, and contend with school work, this blog ended up becoming very
neglected. It didn't help matters much when I logged on from Safari and
realised none of my fonts were working properly.

I believe I have now solved the font issue (woff files vs woff2 files), and I
have completed all the setup of this system, including getting my ruby workflow
transitioned. So, in theory, we will be able to get back to the good stuff here
shortly.

I have recently joined a small game development startup with some very talented
people, and was berated into using C++ for the game by the way this particular
industry works, so you can expect some future posts about my frustrations with
developing a cross platform game engine in C++.

The goal, for now, is to do the following:

* Write a post on backup software evaluation, and why I went with the software
  I did go with.
* Finish up the Icinga2 Tutorials that have driven quite a lot of traffic to
  this page.
* Write some stuff on game design.

So we will see how that works out. As always, thanks for reading.

P.S. I have decided that I don't really like having analytics on this page,
so over the next few days I am going to root through the code and remove them.
Thank you for your patience.
