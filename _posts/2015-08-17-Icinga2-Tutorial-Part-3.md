__EDIT (2018/12/09):__ _These guides haven't been updated since 2015. It is
possible that there are dead links, or that the configuration syntax has changed
dramatically. These posts are also some of the most popular on my blog. I plan
to do a new guide eventually, but for right now please take the following
entries with a grain of salt._

For this part of the tutorial, we are actually going to be rewriting the host
file for localhost. Unfortunately, I thought the EdgeRouter would be
capable of running an [Icinga2][5] client, but it isnâ€™t available through the
apt repositories, and after the `ntopng` incident of July and August, I am
not stressing that processor any more than it needs to be to run my network.
(It is stressed enough as it is, but that is a post for another day.)

Since I have done most of the explaining in the files, these tutorials will
start including the configuration files, and any external resources
I have used.

### Configuration File ###

```
/*
 * File:        /etc/icinga2/conf.d/captor.conf
 * Title:       Captor Host Configuration File
 * Description: Host and services definition for Icinga2 for
 *              the Captor Localhost.
 * Host:        captor.zyradyl.org
 * System:      Linux Mint Debian Edition 2
 * License:     Creative Commons Zero - Public Domain
 * Version:     1.0

// Host Declaration Block
//
object Host "captor.zyradyl.org" {
    // Define the host IPv4 Address
    address         = "127.0.0.1"
    // Define the host IPv6 Address
    address6        = "::1"
    // Define the operating system
    vars.os         = "Linux"
    // Define a basic functionality test
    // Hostalive does a basic ICMP ECHO to the target
    // specified in the address directive.

}

//
// There are two ways that we can configure Icinga2.
// The first method is to write specific files for
// every host, which is a good idea if you only have
// a few hosts, and every host has something
// different going on. The other method wold be to
// use apply service logic, which is better for
// larger deployments. I have provided links to
// both a best practices guide as well as to a guide
// on apply logic. I will be using files on a per
// host basis for my deployment.

// IPv6 Ping check.

### Import Notes ###
It is worth noting that this article was intended to be a quick write up to
get something online. In time, I may come back to rewrite things, but at the
very least I hope the comments in the file are helpful.
