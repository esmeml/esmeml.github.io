I just spent the past thirty minutes going back and removing a number of the
links that were in my posts up to this point. Nothing important, just links
to Wikipedia or Man Pages, but after speaking with a few friends, I realized
the links weren’t exactly as useful as I thought they were. In addition to this
my build time on Travis-CI had hit about four minutes and all I have to build
is about eight pages, so that’s absurd, and not really scalable. All the
important links have been left in, along with any interesting or amusing ones.

If you are looking for the links, you can go into the github repository for
this site, and look for the commits prior to “Automatic Commit: cleaning up
links”.

This also helps to maintain my sanity, so there’s that. Fifty links in one
article was causing me to worry quite a lot about dead links.
