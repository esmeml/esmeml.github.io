## Final project

Students must organize into groups (up to 4 members) and they must implement a machine learning project that is (a) relevant to the topics discussed in class, (b) require a significant effort from all team members, and (c) unique (i.e., two groups may not choose the same project topic). The projects will vary in both scope and topic, but they must satisfy these criteria. Students are encouraged to begin to think about projects that interest them early on. If a group is unable to come up with its own project idea, it may ask the instructor to provide suggestions on interesting topics.
